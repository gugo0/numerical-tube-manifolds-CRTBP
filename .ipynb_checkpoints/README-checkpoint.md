# numerical-tube-manifolds
This a simple repository for the code that I developed for my bachelor thesis' project.
My aim was to find the tube manifolds of periodic orbits through numerical methods, using as little math as possible. Some knowledge of linear algebra and dynamical systems should be enough to follow the example provided and understand the main concepts.

I'm aware that there are many other methods to find the tube manifolds, more elegant and efficient but also more mathematically complex. I wanted to build a methodology that would allow a STEM student of undergrate level (as was I when I first approached this topic) to calculate these complex trajectories.

My thanks go to professor Christos Efthymiopulous, who has patientelly thought me everything you see in this work.

The functions are divided into two modules, one for the continuous Hamiltonian flow, the other for the discrete Poincar√© map.

The text of my thesis is provided as reference and I've also included a simple example that shows the main ideas behind this work.
